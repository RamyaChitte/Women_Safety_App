# SURAKSHA

Safety for women has become a major issue as the day-by-day cases increasing in all over the world. This proposed project explains women's safety and their security by using an application to send alert message, showing safe location & alert authorities. It suggests a replacement view to use technology to guard women. In this project, an android-based smartphone with an integrated feature that alerts and provides location-based information. It provides self-defence and SMS alert when a woman is in danger. 
The basic problem with the police handling of critical occurrences such as women’s harassment is that they are not always able to respond swiftly to distress calls. These limitations include not knowing the location of the crime and not knowing the crime is occurring at all. It is difficult for the victim to call the police confidently and quietly. So, the problem is to provide safety in a more efficient way for women by utilizing the advancements in technology. To aid in the removal of these prohibitions, this android mobile application presents the Women's Safety Application Suraksha, a smartphone app that provides a reliable way for women to inform about their location during emergency situations to their closed ones or also to call the police in an emergency. 


## Objectives
The purpose of this project is as follows:
To provide a safe environment for women through smartphones, as most people now carry smartphones with them everywhere they go.
To provide an easier way to immediately contact the police or other women’s helpline numbers. 
To send a message containing the user's geographical location to a pre-selected list of emergency contacts such as your loved ones.
To train and support women living in communities to engage with community safety issues.
To provide a platform for women to express their grievances, or any abuse against them to the safety communities without being hesitant.
To provide 24/7 active help and companion for women so that they don't ever feel that they are alone in the middle of a crisis situation.
To build an effective, fast and reliant system to make the women of India feel safe and empowered.
To provide a user-friendly and highly scalable interface for women.
